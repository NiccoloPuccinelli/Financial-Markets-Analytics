# Financial-Markets-Analytics

This exam consisted of an oral test and a project on the main topics of the course.

Here is the work done together with my colleague **Marco Scatassi**. In particular, we built different market portfolios based on different parameters deriving from the regression in the **Market Model** equation and from the application of the **Capital Asset Pricing Model**. The Canadian S&P-TSX60 index was chosen as the basis for the construction.

Final grade: **29**.
